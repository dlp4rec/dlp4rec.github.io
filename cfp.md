title: Call for contribution
---

We are pleased to invite you to contribute to the International Workshop on Deep Learning Practice for High-Dimensional Sparse Data. Topics of interest for DLP 2023 include but are not limited to deep learning based network architecture design, large-scale deep learning training framework, high-performance online inference engines, or toolkits that help break the black box of deep learning models, such as
- Large-scale user response prediction modeling
- Representation learning for high-dimensional sparse data
- Embedding techniques, manifold learning, and dictionary learning
- User behavior understanding
- Large-scale recommendation and retrieval systems
- Large language models and recommender systems
- Model compression for industrial applications
- Scalable, distributed, and parallel training system for deep learning
- High throughput and low latency real-time serving systems
- Applications of transfer learning, meta learning for sparse data
- Auto machine learning, auto feature selection
- Explainable deep learning for high-dimensional data
- Data augmentation, and anomaly detection for high-dimensional sparse data
- Generative adversarial network for sparse data
- Other challenges encountered in real-world applications


# Submission and Formatting Instructions
Submissions are limited to a total of 9 pages in a double-column format (including any diagrams or tables), plus unlimited references. Submissions must be in PDF format and formatted according to the latest [ACM Conference Proceedings Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template#h-latex-authors). Short papers of 2-4 pages are also welcomed. Reviews are not double-blind, and author names and affiliations should be listed. 

All submissions can be made through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dlp2023). We plan to archive the accepted papers (For example, on Springer).
